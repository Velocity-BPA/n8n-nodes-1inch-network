# Automate DeFi Trading with the New 1inch Network Node for n8n

We're excited to announce that Velocity BPA has released a powerful new community node for n8n: the 1inch Network integration. This node brings sophisticated decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregation and trading capabilities directly into your n8n workflows.

## The Challenge of DeFi Automation

For businesses and traders working in the decentralized finance space, managing trades across multiple blockchains and DEX platforms is time-consuming and complex. Whether you're executing token swaps, monitoring prices, or managing limit orders, manual processes create bottlenecks and missed opportunities. Teams need a way to automate these DeFi operations without building custom integrations from scratch.

## Introducing the 1inch Network Node

Our new n8n-nodes-1inch-network brings the full power of 1inch Network's DEX aggregation platform into your automation workflows. This node enables you to programmatically interact with one of DeFi's most trusted trading protocols, all through n8n's intuitive visual interface.

## Key Features

**Multi-Chain Support**: Execute trades across 12+ EVM-compatible networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and more - all from a single node.

**DEX Aggregation**: Automatically find the best swap rates across dozens of decentralized exchanges, ensuring optimal trade execution.

**Fusion Gasless Swaps**: Take advantage of 1inch's innovative Fusion mode for gas-free token swaps, reducing transaction costs significantly.

**Limit Orders**: Set and manage limit orders programmatically, automating your trading strategies without constant monitoring.

**Cross-Chain Trading**: Build workflows that span multiple blockchain networks, enabling sophisticated multi-chain trading strategies.

## Real-World Use Cases

Imagine automating portfolio rebalancing based on market conditions, executing arbitrage strategies across chains, or building a trading bot that responds to on-chain events. With this node, these scenarios become straightforward n8n workflows.

## Getting Started

Installation is simple. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-1inch-network


Restart n8n, and you'll find the 1inch Network node available in your node palette. The node is fully documented with examples to help you build your first DeFi automation workflow quickly.
